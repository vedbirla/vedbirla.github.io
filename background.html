            <h2>Self Study</h2>
            <p>
                In my education journey, I found that many classes felt incomplete in some way, like they were explaining most of the intricacies of the topic but leaving out some crutial details. I would question any small fallacy in the logic of the class, and it often led me down rabbit holes. Eventually, I compliled a list of specific topics I had found insufficiently explained. <br>
                <br>
                When I was in high school, I would end up reading ahead and learn about the complex plane and other such topics that would make my studies feel more whole. Eventually, of course, I moved on to more complex topics, fueled by my curiosity. <br>
                <br>
                Right now, I have started self studying into topics such as the Lie Group and applications, quasicrystal properties, and other solid state physics topics. I also took a brief detour into Quantum Error Correction algorithms, and am now reading about various solid state physics topics.
